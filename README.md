# Text-to-Hand-writing-convertor-
Text to Handwritten PDF Converter

Text to Handwritten is a desktop application that converts typed text or documents into realistic handwritten-style PDF pages. It is designed for students and professionals who want their digital text to look like natural handwriting, complete with spacing variations, ink color control, background pages, and support for mathematical superscripts and subscripts.

Built using Python, CustomTkinter, and Pillow, the app provides a modern dark-mode UI and produces high-resolution, multi-page handwritten PDFs suitable for assignments and notes.
